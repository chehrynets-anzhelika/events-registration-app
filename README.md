# Events Registration App

## About this app

This project is a test task. This is a web application for event registration. The application has three pages:

☑️ **Board** - the main page where the user lands when launching the application. It contains a list of events in the form of cards. Each event contains:
* title;
* description;
* date;
* organizer;
* «**Registration**» and «**View**» buttons;

------
☑️ **Registration** - the page where the user lands by clicking on the Registration button. A modal window appears on the page where the user must enter their data:
* Full name;
* Email;
* Date of birth;
* Choose the source from where they learned about the event.

All fields are mandatory. After the user clicks «**Save**», their data is stored in the <u>Firebase</u> database.

-----

☑️ **Participants** - the page where the user goes by clicking on the «**View**» button in the event card. On this page, user can see all the participants who have registered for this event. If there are no users, there will be a message.
